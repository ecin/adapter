# Adapter.define also takes any combination of module and block.
#
# If module present, it is included. If block present, it is turned
# into a module and included. This means that including a module and
# a block allows overriding the module by defining methods in the block.
#
# In our case below, we simply override the memory adapter to create
# a new adapter that encodes/decodes using JSON instead of the default
# Marshal.load/dump. Also, important to note that this does not affect
# the memory adapter which still uses Marshal.
